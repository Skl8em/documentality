Known technical debt: things we chose to defer, each with *why* and *how to resolve*.
This is a **current** register (a debt is removed when it is paid), distinct from [`open-questions`](open-questions.md) (undecided questions) and the roadmap (planned phases).

## Legacy count-named records

**What:** existing records still use sequential-count names — the ADRs (`ADR-001`…`ADR-027`) and the phase folders (`phase-01-foundation`…`phase-09-tooling`) — while new records follow the [ULID identifiers decision](../phases/refoundation/phase-09-tooling/ulid-identifiers.md): a `<slug>.md` filename with a ULID `id` in frontmatter.
The corpus therefore carries two naming schemes at once.

**Why left open:** the decision (ADR-028) deliberately keeps the naming convention open, rather than forcing a corpus-wide rename now.
Adopting `id`/`slug` on the legacy records — and choosing whether their filenames become `<slug>.md` or `<slug>-<ulid>.md` — is a per-record judgement, not a debt that must be paid on a schedule.

**How to resolve (when we choose):** add `id`/`slug` to a record's frontmatter (mint with `scripts/ulid.py` — ADRs chronological, phases ordinal via an `order` key), then normalise its filename with `scripts/slugify_names.py` (→ `<slug>.md`) or `scripts/migrate_ids.py` (→ `<slug>-<ulid>.md`); both rewrite all references via the safe-rename core, gated by `linkcheck` + `slug_check` + `ulid_check`.

## Linter-grandfathered content

**What:** `phases/naive-sketch/**` (pre-ADR-021 records), `imagining/**` (informal Phase-II notes), and the blind-test transcripts are excluded from markdownlint / the frontmatter linter.

**Why:** they predate the current conventions or are not authored prose; forcing them into compliance would be churn without value.

**How to resolve:** bring a file into the catalogue (frontmatter + one-sentence-per-line) and remove it from the ignore lists when it stops being historical/informal — case by case, not in bulk.
